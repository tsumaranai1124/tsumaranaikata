Memories broken, the truth goes unspoken
I've even forgotten my name
I don't know the season or what is the reason
I'm standin' here holding my blade
A desolate place (Place) without any trace (Trace)
It's only the cold wind I feel
It's me that I spite as I stand up and fight
The only thing I know for real
There will be blood (Blood) shed (Shed)
The man in the mirror nods his head
The only one (One) left (Left)
Will ride upon the dragon's back
Because the mountains don't give back what they take
Oh no, there will be blood (Blood) shed (Shed)
It's the only thing I've ever known
